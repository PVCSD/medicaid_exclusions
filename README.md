# Get A List of Employees who may be on the State of Federal Medicaid Exclusion list

This repo shows a barebones application designed to aid in determining if any staff members are on the State/Federal Exclusions list. 

You can see the [demo app here](https://pleasval.shinyapps.io/medicaid_exclusions/)

The app will requrire 3 files that are saved as a CSV

* Federal Exclusion List
* State Exclusion List
* Staff list

Details on how to prepare those files can be found in a Google Sheets Document which has a tab for each template.
